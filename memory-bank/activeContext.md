# Active Context - Click Target Game

## Current Work Focus

Transitioning the existing Phaser 3 space demo into a fully functional Click Target Game with all core features implemented.

## Recent Changes & Current State

- **Existing Implementation**: Basic space-themed Phaser demo with flying ship animation
- **Project Configuration**: Set up for 1280x720 resolution with "Click Target Game" title
- **Asset Structure**: Basic asset loading system in place
- **Scene Architecture**: Single Start scene currently implemented

## Active Development Priorities

### 1. Core Game Mechanics (High Priority)

- Implement random target spawning system
- Create target click/tap detection with proper input handling
- Develop scoring system with real-time display
- Add timer functionality with visual countdown
- Integrate sound effects for successful hits

### 2. Game State Management (Medium Priority)

- Create proper game states: Start → Gameplay → Game Over
- Implement start screen with "Tap to Start" functionality
- Design game over screen with final score display
- Add restart functionality

### 3. Mobile Optimization (High Priority)

- Ensure touch input works seamlessly with mouse clicks
- Implement responsive scaling for all screen sizes
- Optimize target size for easy finger tapping
- Test cross-platform compatibility

## Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture Approach

- **Scene-Based Structure**: Use Phaser scenes for different game states
- **Component Design**: Modular approach for target management
- **State Management**: Centralized game state handling
- **Event-Driven**: Use Phaser's event system for game flow

### Input Handling Strategy

- **Unified Input System**: Single system handling both mouse and touch
- **Event Listeners**: Proper event binding for cross-platform support
- **Touch Optimization**: Larger hit areas for mobile devices

### Asset Management

- **Preload Phase**: Load all assets during scene preload
- **Sprite Management**: Efficient target sprite handling
- **Audio Integration**: Proper sound effect loading and playback

## Next Implementation Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Next 2-3 hours)

1. Create Target class/component for spawnable targets
2. Implement random positioning logic within game bounds
3. Add click/tap detection with hit feedback
4. Create scoring system with visual display
5. Implement 30-second timer with countdown

### Short-term Goals (This week)

1. Complete core gameplay loop
2. Add start and game over screens
3. Integrate all required assets
4. Implement responsive design
5. Conduct cross-platform testing

## Important Considerations

### Performance Optimization

- **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60fps during target spawning
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of destroyed targets
- **Asset Loading**: Efficient preloading of all resources

### User Experience

- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of successful hits
- **Audio Cues**: Satisfying sound effects for interactions
- **Progress Indicators**: Visible timer and score updates
- **Accessibility**: Large touch targets and clear visuals

## Active Patterns & Preferences

### Code Structure

- **ES6 Classes**: Modern JavaScript class structure
- **Modular Scenes**: Separate scenes for different game states
- **Component-Based**: Reusable target components
- **Event-Driven**: Phaser event system integration

### Development Approach

- **Iterative Development**: Build core features first, then enhancements
- **Mobile-First**: Design with mobile constraints in mind
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensure consistent experience across devices
- **Performance-Focused**: Optimize for smooth gameplay
